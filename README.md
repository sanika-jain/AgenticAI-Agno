Creation of AI Agents using AGNO
-----------------------------------------
AGNO:
  
  Agno is a lightweight library for building Agents with memory, knowledge, tools and reasoning.
  
  Here are some key features:
  
    Model Agnostic: Agno Agents can connect to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
    
    Lightning Fast: Agents instantiate in ~3μs and use ~5Kib memory on average (see performance for more details).
    
    Reasoning is a first class citizen: Make your Agents “think” and “analyze” using Reasoning Models, ReasoningTools or our custom chain-of-thought approach.
    
    Natively Multi-Modal: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they can take in text, image, audio and video and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
    
    Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (Agent Teams) with 3 different modes: route, collaborate and coordinate.
    
    Agentic Search built-in: Give your Agents the ability to search for information at runtime using one of 20+ vector databases. Get access to state-of-the-art Agentic RAG that uses hybrid search with re-ranking. Fully async and highly performant.
    
    Long-term Memory & Session Storage: Agno provides plug-n-play Storage & Memory drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
    
    Structured Outputs: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or json_mode.
    
    Pre-built FastAPI Routes: Agno provides pre-built FastAPI routes to serve your Agents, Teams and Workflows.
    
    Monitoring: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on agno.com.

**Level 1: Basic**

Build a basic “Hello World” agent
Develop a single agent (no tools) powered by an LLM

Sample interaction
User: What are the principles of OOPS?
AI: (whatever answer we get from LLM)

**Level 2: Conversational Memory**

Solve and learn conversation state through agents

User: My name is Sakhi, and I am an engineering student interested in compiler design and ML. What are some good career options?
AI: (some answer from LLM)
User: What are some relevant textbooks that align with my interests?
AI: (based on prior info.... )

Approach:
1. Built-In Memory: Every Agent has built-in memory that keeps track of the messages in the session, i.e., the chat history.

    (Note: The default memory is not persisted across execution cycles. So after the script finishes running, or the request is over, the built-in default memory       is lost.)
2. Session Storage: Storage helps us save Agent sessions and state to a database or file.
Adding storage to an Agent is as simple as providing a storage driver, and Agno handles the rest. You can use SQLite, Postgres, Mongo, or any other database you want.
3. User Memory: Agents can also create user memories based on the conversation history. To enable user memories, give your Agent a Memory object and set enable_agentic_memory=True.
 
**Level 3: Tools**

Integrate web search (e.g., Google Search) with agentic flow  (like Perplexity)

User: What is the latest on US tariffs?
AI: (performs the search and returns the results relevant to the search - but not as a list of search results but relevant answer to the question)
 
**Level 4: Vector Store**

Create a vector store (e.g., Compiler Design book) and push content into it
Vectorize a resume and extract structured info
Design sequential or parallel agent workflows
Enable agent-to-tool calling
Enable OCR (traditional or GenAI) to read scans as well

User: What is my AIR? What is my CGPA?
AI: (based on the resume - the ans should be provided)
 
**Level 5: Notebook LM mimic**

Implement a multi-agent, multi-tool system (PDFs, YouTube urls, Web Page urls, copy & paste text)
Create a Google NotebookLM like feature to generate a mind map from large data dumps within this program
Create a NotebookLM style audio podcast (User: create podcast on challenges of compiler design?)
