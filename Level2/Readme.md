**1. Built-in:**
--
*built-in.py* is an example script that demonstrates how to create a conversational AI agent with built-in memory using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

Key Features :
- Built-in memory to include previous chat history in conversations.
- Contextual awareness by specifying how many previous responses to remember.
- A positive, polite assistant persona via a custom description.
- Creates a web-based playground app for interactive conversations with the agent.

⚙️ **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

▶️ **Run the script**

```python built-in.py```

**2. Built-in-cli:**
--
*built-in-cli.py* is a command-line example that demonstrates how to interact with a conversational AI agent with built-in memory using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

⚙️ **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

▶️ **Run the script**

```python built-in-cli.py```

**3. Session-storage:**
--
*session-storage.py* is an example script that demonstrates how to create a conversational AI agent with persistent session memory using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

Initializes an AI agent ("SessionStorageAgent") with:
- The Gemini model for language understanding.
- Persistent conversation memory using SQLite, so chat history is saved across sessions and script restarts.
- A fixed session ID to ensure continuity of the same conversation over multiple runs.
- Contextual awareness by including previous chat history in the model input.

⚙️ **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

▶️ **Run the script**

```python session-storage.py```

This file is a practical starting point for building persistent, context-aware conversational agents using agno, Gemini, and SQLite storage.

**5. user-memory:**
--
*user-memory.py* is an advanced example demonstrating how to build a conversational AI agent with both persistent session memory and user-specific long-term memory using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

This sets up two types of memory:
- User-specific memory: Stores long-term user information in a dedicated SQLite database.
- Session (conversation) memory: Stores chat history in a separate SQLite database for persistent context across sessions.
   
Initializes an AI agent ("UserMemoryAgent") with:
- The Gemini model for language understanding.
- Both user and agent memory enabled for richer, more personalized conversations.
- Contextual awareness by including previous chat history in the model input.
- Markdown formatting, streaming responses, and session summaries enabled.

⚙️ **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

▶️ **Run the script**

```python user-memory.py```

This file is a practical starting point for building highly personalized, context-aware conversational agents using agno, Gemini, and advanced memory management.

**6. user-memory-cli:**
--
*user-memory-cli.py* is an advanced command-line example that demonstrates how to build a conversational AI agent with both persistent session memory and user-specific long-term memory using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

⚙️ **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

▶️ **Run the script**

```python user-memory-cli.py```

This file is a practical starting point for building highly personalized, context-aware conversational agents in a command-line environment using agno, Gemini, and advanced memory management.
