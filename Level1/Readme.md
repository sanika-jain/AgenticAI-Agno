Creation of a Basic HelloWorld Agent
--
**File: l1.py**

*l1.py* is a minimal example demonstrating how to create and deploy a conversational AI agent using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

What does this file do?
1. Loads environment variables (including your Google API key) for secure configuration.
2. Initializes a simple AI agent (HelloWorld) using the Gemini model, with Markdown formatting enabled for responses.
3. Creates a web-based playground app for interactive conversations with the agent.
4. Runs the playground server so you can chat with the agent in your browser.
5. How to use
   
    Add your GOOGLE_API_KEY to a .env file in the project directory.
  
    Run the script: *python l1.py*
  
6. Open the provided web interface to interact with the agent.

This file is ideal for getting started with agno and Gemini, serving as a foundation for more advanced conversational AI projects.

**File : l1-config.py**

*l1-config.py* is an example script that demonstrates how to configure and interact with an AI agent using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

What does this file do?
1. Loads environment variables (including your Google API key) for secure configuration.
2. Initializes an AI agent (HelloWorld) with the Gemini model, enabling Markdown formatting and monitoring for debugging.
3. Prompts the agent to generate a detailed report on "NVDA" (NVIDIA), streaming the response with full reasoning and intermediate steps for transparency.
4. How to use

    Add your GOOGLE_API_KEY to a .env file in the project directory.

    Run the script: *python l1-config.py*
   
5. View the streamed, step-by-step report generated by the agent in your terminal.

This file is a practical starting point for configuring AGNO agents and generating detailed, transparent AI outputs for specific prompts.
