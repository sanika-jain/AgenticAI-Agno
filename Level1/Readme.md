Creation of a Basic HelloWorld Agent
--
### File: l1.py

*l1.py* is a minimal example that sets up a conversational AI agent using the Agno framework and Gemini model, with a web-based playground for interaction. Ideal for quick experimentation and as a starting point for custom agents.

üîß **Setup**

In the project root, create a .env file containing:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è**Run the Script**

```python l1.py```

### File : l1-config.py

*l1-config.py* is an example script that demonstrates how to configure and interact with an AI agent using the agno framework and the Gemini language model.

‚öôÔ∏è **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run the script**

```python l1-config.py```

The agent will stream a transparent, traceable report directly to your terminal ‚Äî making this script a great starting point for building explainable AI workflows with Agno.

Output on CLI (With Intermediate Steps):
