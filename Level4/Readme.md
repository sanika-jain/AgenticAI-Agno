l4-w.py is an advanced example script that demonstrates how to build an end-to-end document question answering (Q&A) workflow using the Agno framework, the Gemini language model, and ChromaDB for vector storage.

üîë Key Features
- Downloads and processes PDFs from a URL
- Uses Gemini embeddings + ChromaDB for semantic search
- Answers user questions based on document content using a Gemini agent
- Caches repeated queries for faster responses
- Maintains workflow state with SQLite
- Includes retry logic for Google API quota errors
- Launches an interactive Agno Playground web UI for real-time Q&A

‚öôÔ∏è **Setup**

Create a .env file in the project root:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
AGNO_API_KEY=your-agno-api-key
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run the script**

```python l4-w.py```


üé®**Customization:**
